ONLINE RESUME

Second project from the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree in Udacity: 
we have to write the JavaScript that powers our own interactive resume. We'll build our resume by writing a JS script that will combine our personal information with pre-written HTML and CSS templates to generate the resume.
